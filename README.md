# Classification-of-Waste-Material-using-Deep-Learning-CNN-
This project implements a deep learning–based waste classification system capable of identifying whether a given waste image belongs to the Organic or Recyclable category.It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on a structured dataset and deployed using a Flask-based web interface.
